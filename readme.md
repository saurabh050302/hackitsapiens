Plan was to -> Build a basic site -> Make it decentrlized -> Store user data and quiz scores on a decentralised network

Couldn't execute because of insufficient knowledge in the field and time limits

Created this basic website with following features -
-> Site registration
-> Site login
-> Homepage - corousel + about section + cards
-> Quiz - 10 random questions out of 40 provided in database

More ideas -
-> Leaderboard System
-> API integration
-> Filters a/c to difficulty or topics etc.
